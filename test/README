See bin/run.sh in etherpad repository for explanation of what this is for.

dirty.db - Created by a very early version of the Etherpad Sandstorm app, running etherpad 1.3.0
* Should have edits from the primary user, a different logged in user, and an anon user.
* Should have bold, italic, underline, striketru, numbered items, bullet items, and 3 levels of indentation.
Results from importing as of 2022:
* It does show up as three different users, but specific user ID not preserved. Just gonna call this a best-effort good-enough for such old grains.

sqlite3.db - Created by a 2017 version of the Etherpad Sandstorm app, running etherpad 1.6.1
* Should have edits from the primary user, a different logged in user, and an anon user.
* Should have a comment from the primary user, a different logged in user, and a different anon user than the above.
* Should have bold, italic, underline, striketru, numbered items, bullet items, 3 levels of indentation.
* Should have Superscript, Subscript, Blue text, green text, Headings 1-6, Code, Font size 8 and 20, Font Family Avant Gard and Times New Roman, Align Left Right Center and Justified

Results from importing as of 2022:
* Font size, *not preserved*
* Justified actually seems to work, whereas it didn't in the 2017 version.
