**No more sending your stuff back and forth via email; just create a pad, share it, and start collaborating!**

Etherpad allows you to edit documents collaboratively in real-time, much like a live multi-player editor that runs in your browser. Write articles, press releases, to-do lists, etc. together with your friends, fellow students or colleagues, all working on the same document at the same time.

This is a Sandstorm port of Etherpad based on [the Etherpad foundation's "Etherpad Lite"](http://etherpad.org).
